# FHIRedSHIP


A comprehensive and integrated information system to manage (a) social needs identified in clinical settings, (b) bi-directional information exchange between clinical providers and community-based organizations (CBOs) delivering social care, (c) integration in
clinical workflow and electronic health record (EHR), and (d) patients’ access, consent, and navigation using a mobile digital platform. This “closed loop” system, we have named FHIRed-SHIP, can be defined as one that helps a clinical provider to identify social needs of a patient, make referral to a social service organization that may address those social needs, and receive information back in their clinical EHR environment from the social service organization, thus closing the information loop of social service referrals in our community.
